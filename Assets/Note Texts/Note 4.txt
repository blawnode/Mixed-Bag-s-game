To the sorry sucker who's alive to read this: 

		Good luck.

I don't know what the hell happened, but I haven't
got much time left. Oxygen's running low and the nearest
sign of intelligent life is a cool two-hundred-million 
miles away-- as far as we know, that is. 

One second, I was performing a routine hull inspection, then
BOOM!-- Knocked out cold. Now I'm here, swimming in this
perpetual abyss until it wrings out my last breath.

God, this sucks.
