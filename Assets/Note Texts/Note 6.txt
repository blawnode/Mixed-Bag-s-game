(Prof. Tohiro): 
This is Professor Akimasa Tohiro, detailing a spacial anomaly. The current date is 11/18/2̵̧̛͑̊̒̊͂͗̇̃̒͘͘͝͝͝͝0̷̡̛̠̠͎͙̫̜̯̥̥̏͒̎̍̄̈́͊̒̾̑̉͘͘̕͠X̴̨̛̯͔͍̘͈̫̘̙̪͈̭̦̥̋̒͐̇̆͛͂̾͑̓̈́̋̓͑̾̎̇̾͛͗̕̚͘͝͝͠͠ͅͅX̶̛͖͖̦̭͔͖͍͈̙̰͊̈́̐́̀͐̄̄̉̎͂̏̀̍́͜͝͝ , 18:13:19. Our sensors seems to have been reading an unusual quantity of spacetime distortions these past few weeks. A rather significant shift from the data we've collected over the course of two years.

Radars, medical tools, and electromagnetic sensors have been malfunctioning.
Sudden blackouts, misreads, and blips are becoming more commonplace.
Assistance has been requested from mission control over these issues, and a response is expected within a few months. 

I will keep these logs updated with any future developments.
