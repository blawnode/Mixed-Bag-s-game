(Prof. Tohiro): 
This is Professor Akimasa Tohiro, detailing a spacial
anomaly. The current date is 11/18/2̵̧̛͑̊̒̊͂͗̇̃̒͘͘͝͝͝͝0̷̡̛̠̠͎͙̫̜̯̥̥̏͒̎̍̄̈́͊̒̾̑̉͘͘̕͠X̴̨̛̯͔͍̘͈̫̘̙̪͈̭̦̥̋̒͐̇̆͛͂̾͑̓̈́̋̓͑̾̎̇̾͛͗̕̚͘͝͝͠͠ͅͅX̶̛͖͖̦̭͔͖͍͈̙̰͊̈́̐́̀͐̄̄̉̎͂̏̀̍́͜͝͝ , at the time
of 18:13:19. Our sensors seems to have been reading an
unusual quantity of spacetime distortions these past few weeks,
which is a rather significant shift from the data we've collected
over the course of two years.

Alongside these occurrences, other equipment, including radars,
medical tools, and electromagnetic sensors have been malfunctioning.
Sudden blackouts, misreads, and blips are becoming more commonplace.
Assistance has been requested from mission control over these issues,
and a response is expected within a few months. 

I will keep these logs updated with any future developments.
