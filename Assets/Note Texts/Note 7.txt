(What happened here?
Where did everyone go? 
Am I really out here all by myself?
Is this note the only thing that survived!?

No, that can't be true--
there must be signs of life elsewhere.
I need to keep looking.

The numbers down here have to mean 
something; maybe they'll help me
escape this hell.)
