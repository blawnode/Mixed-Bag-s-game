Capt. Daniels | Message 213

This damn ship is so unsettling; you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but it never gets any better...
Every day is one menial task after another, and you could go on and on about how "important" our job is
for the progression of humanity, but I've never cared for any of that pretentious nonsense. 

The most terrifying thing about this whole expedition isn't the loneliness, the endless void
laid out before our eyes, or even the overwhelming burden of our responsibilities-- it's the f%#$@^$ BOREDOM!

Every night-- or, whatever you wanna call it-- there's this creeping sense of dread that fills my chest right 
before I pass out, and it's only gotten worse as time goes by... Maybe it's the idleness; I haven't had an
interesting thing to do within the past, what, three-- two years? I think I've gotta be going stir-crazy or 
something.

I just hope something interesting happens soon.
