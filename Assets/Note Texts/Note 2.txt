This damn ship is so unsettling; you'd think I'd be used to it by now, but it never gets any better... You could go on and on about how "important" our job is for humankind, but I've never cared for any of that pretentious nonsense.

The most terrifying thing about this whole expedition isn't the loneliness, the endless void laid out before our eyes, or even the overwhelming burden of our responsibilities-- it's the F%#$@^$ BOREDOM!

Every night-- or, whatever you wanna call it-- there's this creeping sense of dread that fills my chest right 
before I pass out. I haven't had an interesting thing to do within the past, what, three-- two years? 
I hope anything interesting happens soon.
